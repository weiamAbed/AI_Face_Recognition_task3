# AI_Face_Recognition_task3
This repository is for task (3) of the AI track of my summer training at Smart-Methods

On this task, we worked on real-time face recognition using python, visual studio code, OpenCV, Python Virtual Environment, and more on my OS Windows 10.

1- I Installed Python 3.9.6 through their main website and I checked the box "Add Python 3.9 to path" then started the installation.

To check python version in CMD type: 

      python --version

2- I downloaded Visual Studio (The community edition and check Python Development package, Node.JS, Desktop web c++).

3- Downloaded Visual Studio Code by following the simple installation steps.

4- From Face Recognition official website and copied the following code (source method):

    git clone git://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition

5- After that, I created a directory on my desktop called "facerecog".

6- Through the terminal, I entered the directory path and cloned the previous source method code.

7- Unfortunately, I faced the following error " git: the term 'git' is not recognized.." and fixed it by downloading GIT from the official website.
And to check the error has was successfuly solved type 'git' in a new PowerShell and I noticed the error was successfully solved.

8- In the same directory path I executed the following which took a lot of time to download the packages:

    pip install virtualenv
 
9- After I entered this code:

    virtualenv weiamenv

10- I entered the path of the newly created environment and entered the Scripts path to run the following in order to activate the environment:

    .\activate

11- Here I faced the following error "File Cannot Be Loaded Because Running Scripts Is Disabled on This System" and fixed it with the following steps:

First, Right-click on Windows Power Shell Select "Run as administrator"

    Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    Y
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

12- Inside the python virtual environment I ran:

    pip install cmake

    pip install numpy==1.21.0

    pip install opencv-python

13- Also, which took a lot of time to download all the necessary packages.

    python setup.py install

14- I added this code to check the packages are installed "check the picture"

    pip freeze

15- To open up the python shell:

    python

16- Then entered:

    import face_recognition

    import cv2

**Note: To activate/deactivate the virtual environment follow the steps:**

**In CMD in the path of your project folder enter this code to Activate:**

    env\Scripts\activate.bat

To Deactivate type in the same previous path:

    deactivate

17- In visual studio code I used the following python code:

    import numpy as np

    import face_recognition as fr

    import cv2 

    video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

    conner_image = fr.load_image_file("conner.jpg")
    conner_face_encoding = fr.face_encodings(conner_image)[0]

    known_face_encondings = [conner_face_encoding]
    known_face_names = ["Conner"]

    while True: 
  
    ret, frame = video_capture.read()

    rgb_frame = frame[:, :, ::-1]

    face_locations = fr.face_locations(rgb_frame)
    face_encodings = fr.face_encodings(rgb_frame, face_locations)

    for (top, right, bottom, left), face_encoding in zip(face_locations, face_encodings):

        matches = fr.compare_faces(known_face_encondings, face_encoding)

        name = "Unknown"

        face_distances = fr.face_distance(known_face_encondings, face_encoding)

        best_match_index = np.argmin(face_distances)
        if matches[best_match_index]:
            name = known_face_names[best_match_index]

        cv2.rectangle(frame, (left, top), (right, bottom), (0, 0, 255), 2)

        cv2.rectangle(frame, (left, bottom -35), (right, bottom), (0, 0, 255), cv2.FILLED)
        font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
        cv2.putText(frame, name, (left + 6, bottom - 6), font, 1.0, (255, 255, 255), 1)

    cv2.imshow('Webcam_facerecognition', frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

    video_capture.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
    
18- Run Python file in terminal, To exit the camera (stop run) just type "q" 

**This is the reference picture of Conner I used for this project:**

**^^Please check the screen recording of TESTING the project if it can define 'Conner' from other characters in the images and trailer video is in the attached files in this REPOSITORY^^**
